    <div class=port_qual_titles>Timed opening of websites (TKINTER Desktop Application)</div>
    <div class=portfolio_text>This is a project I worked on with three teammates for a hackaton. The 
        application isnâ€™t completely finished. I worked on the frontend and am working on integrating the 
        frontend and the backend together.  The desktop application was made with zoom classes in mind. 
        The user can enter the information of a recurring event and the website related to it. The application 
        will be running in the background and will open the website on a web browser on the given time.

    <div class=port_qual_titles>Cache Simulator (Python program)</div>
    <div class=portfolio_text>This was a project for a hardware focused class which I worked teammate on.
         We built a cache simulation based on recently-used and frequently-used eviction policies.
          The user could also choose the word size and other parameters of the cache.

    <div class=port_qual_titles>Future Projects</div>
    <div class=portfolio_text>I want to work on a project that takes data from companies and does calculations 
        for widely used parameters to help with stock decisions. One application would be to calculate the net 
        annualized gain and make comparisons to other investment methods. The data focus and the personal need 
        of the project is the reason I want to work on this.</div>
