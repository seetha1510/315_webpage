    <p>I believe giving back to the community is an important part of education. 
        As I learn and progress, I want to use my resources to help others succeed too. 
        Hence, I am greatly involved in service around the Bryan-College Station area. 
        I volunteer with numerous organization such as Build (an organization involved in 
        converting containers into medical clinic units) and <a href=https://www.twincitymission.org/>
        Twin City Missions </a>
        (an organization that provides help to the homeless and domestic abuse victims). 
        I have also participated in the <a href=https://bigevent.tamu.edu/>Big Event</a> in 
        College Station, a day-long event to 
        help community members with yard work, and the <a href=https://www.aggiemiracle.com/>
        Aggie Dance Marathon</a>, a fundraising 
        event for the McLane Children&#8217;s Medical Center, for the last two years. </p>

    <p>In addition, I am serving as the Servant Leadership Executive in FLASH (Freshmen Leading 
        in Service and Honor) for the academic year of 2020-2021. This position comes after 
        a year as a member and a year as a staff member in this organization. During the 
        past two years in this organization, I was part of the organizing team for community 
        projects such a Week of Kindness, when we distribute scantrons along with words of
         encouragement to students on campus during finals week and Adopt-A-Highway, when
          we clean a section of highway in the Spring semester. This year I get to facilitate
           more service events with other staff members to increase freshmen involvement in 
           the community and campus. We are actively working on creating more remote service
            options, as there is more need during these difficult times. Some ideas we are 
            looking forward to effectuate this year are writing letters to children hospitals, 
            lunch drives for local health workers and mask drive for those in need. </p>

    <p>I want to continue being actively involved in my community and serve those in need. 
        I want my work in the Computer Science field to also mirror this passion,
         by ensuring that my work positively contributes to the society and directly impacts 
         those who need help. </p>
