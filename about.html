        <div class=about_titles>Hi, I'm Seetha</div>
        <p> Hello! I&#8217;m a Junior Computer Science major with a pre-medical track at Texas A&M. I&#8217;m 
            passionate about service and giving back. When I&#8217;m not programming or learning complex
            biochemical pathways, I&#8217;m usually planning logistics for <a href https://www.aggieflash.com/> FLASH </a> 
            (Freshmen Leaders Advancing
            in Service and Honor), an freshmen leadership organization I have been involved in for three
            years and am currently serving as the Service Executive for this organization. I was a Big in
            the organization last year and I loved spending time with my freshmen and helping them settle 
            into campus life. More importantly, it is fun to work with the other amazing staff members to 
            host events all year long.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;m from Chennai, India and moved to Texas during the junior year of high school. So, I like to
            think I have a good mix of Texan and Indian culture. Personal aspects of my life that I enjoy a
            lot are my hobby to stitch, annoy my dog and play badminton with my friends. I love reading novels
            and short stories on the internet. Another part of life I love is travelling, especially with my friends!
            I have been to multiple countries with my family, but travelling to Denver with friends is my favorite trip 
            so far.</p>
        
        <p>My mix in interest in the medical field and computer science is because I want to work in the health 
            field to help those in need. I want to work in the intersection between computer science and the medical 
            field - the health informatics sector. I want to have a close understanding of the field I&#8217;m working in and
             therefore I am also pursuing a medical degree. </p>
